## API Integration

The frontend will communicate with the backend API through RESTful endpoints. The API integration strategy includes:

1. **Service Abstraction Layer**

   - Domain-specific service classes (ProductService, OrderService, etc.)
   - Centralized API client configuration
   - Request/response transformation
   - Error handling and retry logic

2. **Data Fetching Strategy**

   - React Query for server state management
   - Optimistic updates for UI responsiveness
   - Polling for real-time data needs
   - Infinite loading for paginated content
   - Prefetching for anticipated user journeys

3. **Authentication Flow**
   - JWT token management
   - Refresh token handling
   - Secured API endpoints
   - Authorization checks

## State Management

The application will use a combination of state management approaches:

1. **Global Application State**

   - React Context API with useReducer
   - Authentication state
   - Cart state
   - UI preferences
   - Global notifications

2. **Server State**

   - React Query for remote data
   - Caching and invalidation
   - Optimistic updates
   - Background refetching

3. **Local Component State**
   - useState for component-specific state
   - Form state with React Hook Form
   - UI interaction states

## Styling Strategy

The application will use Tailwind CSS for styling with the following approach:

1. **Design System Implementation**
