# E-commerce Backend API Documentation

## Overview

This documentation provides comprehensive details about the E-commerce Backend API. The API is built on a modular, service-oriented architecture designed for maximum reusability and scalability.

## API Structure

The API follows RESTful design principles and is organized into the following modules:

- **Inventory Management**: Stock tracking and management
- **Marketing & Promotions**: Discounts, coupons, and promotional campaigns
- **Reviews & Ratings**: Product reviews and star ratings
- **Content Management**: Media and file management
- **Analytics & Reporting**: Sales statistics and performance metrics

## Base URL

All API requests should be prefixed with the base URL:

```
/api/v1
```

## Response Format

All API responses follow a consistent format:

```json
{
  "success": true|false,
  "message": "Human-readable message about the result",
  "data": {
    // Response data object (null if error)
  },
  "error": "Error details (only present if success is false)"
}
```

## Authentication

Most API endpoints require authentication. To authenticate your requests, include the JWT token in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your_token>
```

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request:

- `200 OK`: The request was successful
- `201 Created`: The resource was successfully created
- `400 Bad Request`: The request was invalid or could not be processed
- `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication failed or not provided
- `403 Forbidden`: Authentication succeeded but the user lacks permissions
- `404 Not Found`: The requested resource was not found
- `500 Internal Server Error`: An error occurred on the server

## Pagination

List endpoints support pagination with the following query parameters:

- `page`: Page number (default: 1)
- `limit`: Number of items per page (default varies by endpoint)

Paginated responses include a pagination object with metadata:

```json
"pagination": {
  "total": 100,
  "page": 1,
  "limit": 10,
  "pages": 10
}
```

## Rate Limiting

The API implements rate limiting to prevent abuse. Current limits are:

- Anonymous users: 100 requests per 15-minute window
- Authenticated users: 300 requests per 15-minute window
