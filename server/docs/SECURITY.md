# Security Documentation

This document outlines the security measures and best practices implemented in the e-commerce platform.

## Security Overview

Our security approach focuses on:

1. Authentication and Authorization
2. Data Protection
3. API Security
4. Input Validation
5. Dependency Management
6. Logging and Monitoring
7. Security Headers
8. File Upload Security

## Authentication and Authorization

### JWT Implementation

We use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication with the following security measures:

- Short-lived access tokens (default: 1 hour)
- Longer-lived refresh tokens (default: 30 days)
- Tokens contain minimal payload data
- Tokens are signed with a strong secret key
- Token verification on every protected route

### Password Security

- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with a work factor of 12
- Password strength requirements enforced (minimum 8 characters, must include uppercase, lowercase, number)
- Password reset functionality uses time-limited, single-use tokens
- Failed login attempts are rate-limited

### Role-Based Access Control

The system implements a comprehensive RBAC system:

- User roles: `customer`, `staff`, `manager`, `admin`
- Each API endpoint has specific role requirements
- API responses are filtered based on user roles
- Special operations require elevated privileges

## Data Protection

### Sensitive Data Handling

- PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is encrypted at rest
- Payment information is tokenized, not stored directly
- Database encryption for sensitive fields
- Data masking in logs and error messages

### Database Security

- Database uses authentication with secure credentials
- Database connections use TLS
- Database user has minimal permissions required
- Parameterized queries used to prevent SQL injection
- NoSQL injection prevention for MongoDB operations

## API Security

### Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is implemented to prevent abuse:

- Global rate limits: 100 requests per minute for authenticated users
- Authentication endpoints: 10 attempts per 5 minutes
- IP-based rate limiting for unauthenticated requests
- Different rate limits for different API endpoints based on sensitivity
- Exponential backoff for repeated failed attempts

### CORS Configuration

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is properly configured:

```javascript
// CORS configuration
const corsOptions = {
  origin: process.env.ALLOWED_ORIGINS.split(','),
  methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'PATCH'],
  allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization'],
  credentials: true,
  maxAge: 86400 // 24 hours
};
```

### API Keys and Secrets

- API keys and secrets for third-party services are stored in environment variables
- Different API keys for development and production environments
- Secrets are not logged or exposed in error messages
- Secrets are rotated periodically

## Input Validation

### Request Validation

All API endpoints implement input validation:

- Schema-based validation using Joi or express-validator
- Type checking for all parameters
- Required fields validation
- Business logic validation
- Sanitization to prevent XSS attacks

### Example Validation Schema

```javascript
const userUpdateSchema = Joi.object({
  profile: Joi.object({
    firstName: Joi.string().trim().min(2).max(50),
    lastName: Joi.string().trim().min(2).max(50),
    phone: Joi.string().pattern(/^[+]?[\d\s()-]{8,20}$/)
  }),
  email: Joi.string().email(),
  password: Joi.string().min(8)
    .pattern(/^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)/)
    .message('Password must contain uppercase, lowercase, and number')
});
```

## Dependency Management

### Secure Dependencies

- Regular security audits using `npm audit`
- Automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Pinned dependency versions for stability
- Scheduled dependency updates

### Update Procedure

1. Regularly run security scans:
```bash
npm audit
```

2. Fix vulnerabilities:
```bash
npm audit fix
```

3. For major updates, test thoroughly:
```bash
npm update --depth=1
```

## Logging and Monitoring

### Security Logging

- Authentication events (success and failure) are logged
- Authorization violations are logged with context
- API rate limit exceeded events are logged
- Admin actions are logged with user identification
- Logs are stored securely and cannot be modified

### Log Format

```
{
  "timestamp": "2023-10-05T12:34:56.789Z",
  "level": "warn",
  "message": "Authentication failure",
  "context": {
    "ip": "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx",
    "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
    "email": "u***r@example.com",
    "reason": "Invalid password"
  },
  "requestId": "req-123456"
}
```

### Intrusion Detection

- Monitoring for unusual activity patterns
- Alerts on multiple failed login attempts
- Alerts on unusual API usage patterns
- Geolocation-based access alerting

## Security Headers

We use Helmet.js to implement security headers:

```javascript
app.use(helmet({
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      scriptSrc: ["'self'", "https://js.stripe.com"],
      styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
      imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https://res.cloudinary.com"],
      connectSrc: ["'self'", "https://api.stripe.com"],
      frameSrc: ["'self'", "https://js.stripe.com", "https://razorpay.com"],
      objectSrc: ["'none'"]
    }
  },
  hsts: {
    maxAge: 31536000, // 1 year
    includeSubDomains: true,
    preload: true
  }
}));
```

Key headers implemented:

- Content-Security-Policy
- Strict-Transport-Security
- X-Content-Type-Options
- X-Frame-Options
- X-XSS-Protection
- Referrer-Policy

## File Upload Security

### Upload Restrictions

- File size limits (5MB for images, 10MB for documents)
- File type validation based on MIME type and extension
- Antivirus scanning for uploaded files
- File content validation
- Files stored outside of web root
- Generated filenames to prevent path manipulation

### Image Processing

Images are processed securely:

- Metadata is stripped from images
- Images are resized and optimized
- SVG files are sanitized to prevent XSS
- Thumbnails generated for admin preview
- Image processing is done in a sandboxed environment

## HTTPS Implementation

All traffic must use HTTPS:

- HTTP requests are redirected to HTTPS
- HSTS headers are implemented
- Modern TLS protocols only (TLS 1.2+)
- Strong cipher suites configured
- Perfect Forward Secrecy enabled
- OCSP stapling enabled
- Regular certificate renewal

## Security Incident Response

### Incident Response Plan

1. **Identification**: Monitor and identify potential security breaches
2. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems to prevent further damage
3. **Eradication**: Remove the threat from systems
4. **Recovery**: Restore systems to normal operation
5. **Lessons Learned**: Document the incident and improve security measures

### Contact Information

Security incidents should be reported to:

- Email: security@yourecommerce.com
- Phone: +1-XXX-XXX-XXXX (Security Team)
