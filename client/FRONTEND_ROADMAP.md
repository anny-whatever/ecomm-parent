# E-Commerce Frontend Implementation Roadmap

This document outlines the plan for implementing the frontend for our e-commerce platform, which will seamlessly integrate with the existing backend.

## Project Architecture

We will follow a modular architecture for the frontend, organizing components, pages, and features in a way that promotes maintainability and reusability.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: React.js with Vite

- **Routing**: React Router
- **Form Management**: Formik with Yup validation
- **HTTP Client**: Axios
- **State Management**: React Context API + useReducer for complex state
- **UI Components**: Custom components built with Tailwind
- **Notifications**: react-hot-toast
- **Icons**: react-icons

## API Integration

All API communication will be centralized in service modules, organized by feature domain. Each service will be responsible for communicating with a specific section of the backend API.

## Best Practices

- **Component Design**: Follow atomic design principles (atoms, molecules, organisms)
- **State Management**: Use local state for UI-specific state, context for shared state
- **Error Handling**: Implement consistent error handling and user feedback
- **Loading States**: Provide appropriate loading indicators for async operations
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure all pages work well on all device sizes
- **Accessibility**: Follow WCAG guidelines for accessible web applications
- **Code Splitting**: Implement code splitting for optimized loading times
- **Testing**: Write unit tests for critical components and utilities
